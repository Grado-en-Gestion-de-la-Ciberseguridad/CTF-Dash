- Need to cross-reference with physical evidence

ðŸ”„ **Cryptography Lab**
- Decoded basic Caesar ciphers
- Working on VigenÃ¨re cipher
- Advanced encryption still proving difficult

### Key Findings

#### Suspect Profile: Dr. Alex Morgan
**Evidence Gathered:**
- Late-night campus access logs
- Suspicious social media posts
- Technical expertise matches attack methods
- Previous employment at security firms

**Timeline Correlation:**
- GitHub repository created March 5
- Increased system access requests March 8-12
- Security breach detected March 15

### Investigation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Digital Footprint Analysis âœ…
- [x] Social media investigation
- [x] GitHub repository analysis
- [x] Email pattern analysis
- [x] Network access logs review

#### Phase 2: Physical Evidence Review ðŸ”„
- [x] Campus security footage
- [ ] Office/lab forensics
- [ ] Equipment analysis
- [ ] Witness interviews

#### Phase 3: Pattern Analysis ðŸ“‹
- [ ] Timeline reconstruction
- [ ] Motive analysis
- [ ] Method confirmation
- [ ] Location identification

### Challenges Encountered

1. **Encrypted Communications**
   - Some messages appear to be encoded
   - Need to apply cryptography skills
   - May contain location clues

2. **Access Restrictions**
   - Some evidence requires higher clearance
   - Working with admin team for access
   - Legal considerations for private data

3. **Technical Complexity**
   - Advanced network logs difficult to parse
   - Need specialized tools for analysis
   - Time-consuming manual review

### Action Items

#### High Priority
- [ ] **Emma**: Complete OSINT report on external connections
- [ ] **Michael**: Analyze GitHub code for hidden messages
- [ ] **David**: Cross-reference access logs with incident timeline
- [ ] **Sarah**: Coordinate with admin for additional evidence access

#### Medium Priority  
- [ ] Map all digital evidence to physical locations
- [ ] Create comprehensive suspect profile
- [ ] Identify potential accomplices
- [ ] Document chain of evidence

#### Low Priority
- [ ] Prepare presentation for final report
- [ ] Review campus security recommendations
- [ ] Plan follow-up investigation procedures

### Resource Needs

#### Technical Tools
- Advanced log analysis software
- Cryptography decoding tools
- Network packet analyzers
- Digital forensics equipment

#### Information Access
- Personnel records (authorized access needed)
- Historical security incident reports
- Campus network topology maps
- Vendor security assessment reports

### Next Meeting
**Date:** March 18, 2024  
**Time:** 2:00 PM  
**Location:** Security Operations Center  
**Agenda:** Phase 2 results review and Phase 3 planning
